## Project description

<div style="text-align: justify">
Detecting ideological stances of political actors has mostly been approached by
employing variations of lexical features over textual statements or learning latent
representations in a mostly unsupervised manner. That is, previous approaches trade off
interpretability for depth of semantic and pragmatic analysis. The goal of this project
is to acquire human-interpretable representations of ideological framing from text 
that take up previous work in political science by modelling entity-centric and topic-specific 
ideological frames, their participants and latent moral values in a bottom-up fashion. 
Our approach brings together ideas from Narrative Policy Framework, Moral Foundations Theory 
and frame-semantic parsing. We use our representations to investigate research questions
focusing on frame and ideology coherence as well as the evolution of frames over time.
