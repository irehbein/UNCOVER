Welcome to the project website of the UNCOVER project.

# Project description

Uncovering ideological frames in political discourses (UNCOVER)
is a project funded by the DFG.

Detecting ideological stances of political actors has mostly been approached by
employing variations of lexical features over textual statements or learning latent
representations in a mostly unsupervised manner. That is, previous approaches trade off
interpretability for depth of semantic and pragmatic analysis. The goal of this project
is to acquire human-interpretable representations of ideological framing from text 
that take up previous work in political science by modelling entity-centric and topic-specific 
ideological frames, their participants and latent moral values in a bottom-up fashion. 
Our approach brings together ideas from Narrative Policy Framework, Moral Foundations Theory 
and frame-semantic parsing. We use our representations to investigate research questions
focusing on frame and ideology coherence as well as the evolution of frames over time.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
